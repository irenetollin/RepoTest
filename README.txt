/// Talent4Gig ///
Please Remember to ensure the correct operation to set up a localhost:3306 connection 
with mysql Workbench with the following credentials:
-username: root
-password: admin

Once the credentials are set run the talent4gig.jar executable:
- It creates the database
- It creates all the tables: processes, periodicity and execution_processes
- It populates the tables 

The application basically ask the user the process ID for which executions need to be verified reporting:
- The Process Name
- Periodicty
- Execution Date
- Execution Time
- Execution Status
